This repository was created to store my personal projects around ML to create my first NN! 

It contains the following files:
- a unsupervised K-means model trained for a dataset containing digits: _K-means.ipynb_
- a supervised model for KNearest Neighbour model to classify the car data to evaluate the car on certain attributes: _KNN Car.ipynb_
- a Linear Regression model to predict the final grade of Portuguese students for their Portuguese and Math courses: _Linear_Regression_student_performance.py_
- a Support Vector Model in which data is used to predict malignant or benign breast cancer cells. Used linear regression model from SVM and compared accuracy to KNeighbour classifier: _SVM.ipynb_
